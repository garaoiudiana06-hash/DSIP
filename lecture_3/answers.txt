My current screen resolution is 2880x1800. When I changed the screen orientation to Portrait, the screen shifted from vertical to horizontal, making it hard to see and navigate, as my mouse direction was also flipped. Putting your screen in Portrait mode could help you when you are reading long documents, and using sites formatted for mobile phones. When I changed the resolution to 800x600, everything on the screen became bigger, but lost their quality. Due to their size, few windows could be displayed on the screen and the icons of my apps shifted around.
